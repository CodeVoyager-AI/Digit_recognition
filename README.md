# MNIST Digit Classification with Webcam Integration

This project demonstrates a deep learning model for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It also includes a webcam interface to predict digits in real-time.

## Features
- Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the MNIST dataset.
- Integrated webcam functionality to capture and predict handwritten digits in real-time.
- Used OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow/Keras for model development.

## Requirements
The project uses the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
